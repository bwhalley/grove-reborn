# Grove, Reborn

In 2015, Grove Labs launched the [Grove Ecosystem](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/grove-ecosystem/grove-ecosystem-grow-fresh-food-in-your-home), a beautiful all-in-one home aquaponic system, on Kickstarter. Grove Labs delivered all units, but unfortunately went out of business a few years later.

Grove's Apple Developer membership eventually expired, causing the app (which controls all Grove functionality) to be removed from the iOS App Store. At this point, Grove owners had no way to control their ecosystems.

Thankfully, in its final days, the Grove team [open sourced its iOS app](https://github.com/grovelabs/GroveGardenController), making it fairly trivial to reverse engineer the Grove API and write a custom client for it.

I have written bash scripts that replicate all functionality in the official iOS app, aside from the initial Grove wifi setup. You can find these scripts and instructions to run them in the "client" directory.

I have also provided an OpenSCAD file to 3D print a replacement seedling tray, as my original ones cracked. The replacement model holds four additional seedling pods (12 total).

## Have a Grove and need help?

Sadly, when Grove went out of business, the forum where we congregated went offline. If you're a Grove grower and need help regaining control of your Grove, let me know! I'd be happy to help.

## Acknowledgments

Huge thanks to all Grove Labs employees for designing and shipping a great product, and giving world-class support while they were in business (and occasionally, thereafter).

An especially huge thanks to [@crenwick](https://github.com/crenwick) for answering my questions and giving me the information that made this project possible.
